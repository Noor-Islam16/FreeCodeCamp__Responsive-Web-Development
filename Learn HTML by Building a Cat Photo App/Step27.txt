The code for an ordered list (ol) is similar to an unordered list, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed.

After the second section element's last h3 element, add an ordered list with these three list items:

flea treatment thunder other cats

       <ol>
          <li>flea treatment</li>
          <li>thunder</li>
          <li>other cats</li>
        </ol>
